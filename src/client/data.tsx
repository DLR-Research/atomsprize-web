      <b>Katalin Kariko</b> and <b>Drew Weissman</b> discovered how to make
      messenger RNA technology safe and stable in the early 2000s by modifying
      nucleosides, the building blocks of mRNA.
    </p>
    <p>
      mRNA-based therapies are designed from genetic sequences, allowing the
      COVID-19 vaccines to be quickly developed using the spike protein gene
      from SARS-CoV-2 as a blueprint.
